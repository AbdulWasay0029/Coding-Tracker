## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Clone & Ignite
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdulWasay0029/Coding-Tracker.git
cd Coding-Tracker
npm install
```

### 2. Secrets & Keys 🗝️
Create a `.env` file. This is where the magic happens:
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
SMARTINTERVIEWS_TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"  # Optional: For that deep SmartInterviews tracking
```
*   **How to get it**: Log in to SmartInterviews, open Developer Tools (F12) > Network Tab, refresh, find a request to `/api/...`, and copy the `authorization` header value (without the word "Token ").


### 3. Launch the Mothership (Dashboard)
```bash
npm run dev
```
👉 **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000`
Here you can adding usernames, set your Discord Webhook, and view your army of tracked profiles.

### 4. Deploy & Forget
Set up a Cron Job (or deploy to Vercel). The default schedule is **11:00 PM IST**.
*   **Manual Trigger**: Double-click `trigger_update.bat` in the folder. Boom. Done.

## ❓ FAQ / Troubleshooting


**Q: The dates feel wrong?**
A: We use strict **IST (Indian Standard Time)** midnights. If you solve a problem at 11:59 PM and run the tracker at 12:01 AM, it belongs to *yesterday*. Precision matters!
